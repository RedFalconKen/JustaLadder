# JustaLadder
 This is literally just a ladder for using in DayZ.

Ever need a climbable ladder on your DayZ server? Well I did and was disappointed to find that the ladders from BuilderItems or the base game were decorative and weren't climbable. I was working on putting an oil rig (that had been painstakingly built by another modder in DayZ Editor) on one of my servers. I was saddened to discover that the ladders didn't work, so you couldn't actually climb between levels. When I started looking for a functional ladder but couldn't find one, I went to the BI examples and found that they had some models. I fished one out, modified it slightly to meet my needs, and packed it up. I thought there might be folks that find themselves in a similar situation, so here you go.
